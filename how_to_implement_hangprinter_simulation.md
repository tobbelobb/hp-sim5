# Logic to Implement

Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD) time stepping/physics simulation framework.
We will use substepping as our main method for reducing errors and enhancing stability.
This will probably be part of warp.sim.
We'll probably use warp.sim.

Cable Joints, Matthias MÃ¼ller et al
We'll have to home-roll this.

Probably home-rolled extension to Universal Scene Description (USD) language,
to get the home-rolled Cable Joints in there.

# Software Architecture

Simulations often have many global magic numbers and tuning parameters.
All of those are really just search problems.
We want to avoid manually searching through parameter space.
We want to be able to set a range for each parameter and fire off an automatic search.

## Entity Component System (ECS)

Entities: Simple identifiers (IDs). No data, no logic.
Components: Plain old data structures (PODs). Represent a single aspect of an entity (e.g., Position, Velocity, RenderableMesh, CollidableBody, AffectedByGravity). They contain state, not logic.
Systems: Contain the logic. They operate on entities that possess a specific set of components (e.g., PhysicsSystem queries for entities with Position, Velocity, Mass, CollidableBody; RenderingSystem queries for Position, RenderableMesh).

### ECS combined with Vertical Slice Architecture

We want to separate our program into features,
and have all files and documentation belonging to one feature inside one directory,
so we can give the AI assistant all the context it needs in order to work on a feature with a simple
```
/read ./the_feature/*
```
adding one whole directory to the context window.
No manually curating context snippets or bloating the context window.

This means we copy lots of utility code into each feture directory.
This is ok, as long as we isolate our features from each other.

# Libraries

Nvidia Warp library.
@wp.array for the components of ECS.
We'll have to use something else to manage the entity ids.

Probably VGA. Probably not Isaac Sim for visualization?
We'll learn more about this in later Ten Minute Physics lectures.

Eventually we'll probably want to integrate with Nvidia Omniverse.
That is Omniverse Kit, Isaac Sim via extensions, and Isaac Lab for Reinforcement Learning work.
We will not accept a >10s slow read-evaluate-print cycle, just to get Omniverse during development though.
Find something more light weight initially.


# Tools

Google Code looks like exactly what I want. If it's available?

# Tasks

Copy bead-on-a-wire example.
Make it ECS.
Make it Python.
Implement Cable Joints.
Spilt into separate feature-focused files/directories (Vertical slice architecture).
