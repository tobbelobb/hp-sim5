Okay, testing an ECS architecture combined with Position Based Dynamics (PBD) requires a multi-layered approach. Given your stable state, focusing on regression testing is smart. Here are best practices tailored to your codebase:

1.  **Unit Testing (Lowest Level):**
    *   **Target:** Individual, isolated pieces of logic.
    *   **ECS Context:**
        *   **Utility Functions:** Test your geometry functions (`Vector2` methods, `closestPointOnSegment`, `tangentFrom...`, `signedArcLengthOnWheel`, `lineSegmentCircleIntersection`, `rightOfLine`) rigorously. Include edge cases (zero vectors, points on lines, points inside circles, coincident circles, zero radius, etc.). These are pure functions and easiest to test.
        *   **Component Logic (If Any):** Your components are mostly plain data, which is good. If any components had methods with logic (like `Vector2` does), those methods would be unit tested. Test constructors if they do more than assign values.
        *   **Individual Systems (Mocked World):** This is crucial but can be tricky. To unit test a *single* system (e.g., `GravitySystem`, `PBDCableConstraintSolver`):
            *   Create a *minimal* `World` instance *within the test*.
            *   Add *only* the entities and components that the specific system queries and interacts with. Use simple, predictable initial values.
            *   Manually set any necessary resources (like `dt`, `gravity`).
            *   Execute *only* the `update` method of the system under test.
            *   Assert the *direct results* on the components (e.g., did `GravitySystem` change `VelocityComponent.vel` correctly? Did `PBDCableConstraintSolver` change `PositionComponent.pos` as expected for a simple two-particle joint?).
            *   *Avoid* running the full `world.update()` loop here.
    *   **PBD Context:** Unit tests are less common for the *entire* PBD loop but vital for the *building blocks* (like constraint projection functions if you had them isolated, or the geometry utils).

2.  **Integration Testing (Systems Working Together):**
    *   **Target:** Interactions between multiple systems or complex component relationships within a *single* simulation step or a very small number of steps.
    *   **ECS Context:**
        *   **System Execution Order:** Verify that running systems in their registered order produces the expected intermediate results after one `world.update(dt)` call. For example, does movement happen before collision detection? Does attachment update happen before the constraint solver?
        *   **Cable Logic Flow:** Test the interaction between `CableAttachmentUpdateSystem` and `PBDCableConstraintSolver`. Set up a specific cable scenario (e.g., slight wrap), run `world.update(dt)` once, and check if the attachment points, stored lengths, rest lengths, and entity positions are updated plausibly *together*.
    *   **PBD Context:**
        *   **Constraint Interaction:** Test scenarios where multiple constraints act on the same entity within one step (e.g., a ball involved in a cable joint *and* a collision). Verify the combined outcome after one solver iteration or one full `world.update()`.
        *   **Split/Merge Logic:** Your `CableAttachmentUpdateSystem` has complex split/merge logic. Create specific scenarios designed to *trigger* a split or a merge. Run the system (or `world.update(dt)` once) and assert:
            *   The number of `CableJointComponent` entities is correct.
            *   The `CablePathComponent` reflects the new structure (joints, linkTypes, cw, stored).
            *   The `restLength` and `stored` lengths have been distributed correctly (check conservation of total rest length).
            *   Attachment points are sensible.

3.  **Scenario / End-to-End Testing (Highest Level):**
    *   **Target:** Verifying the outcome of a complete simulation sequence or a specific, complex behavior over multiple time steps.
    *   **ECS/PBD Context:** This is where you test the emergent behavior of the whole simulation.
        *   **Known Stable States:** Simulate simple scenarios (e.g., a ball falling, two balls colliding, a simple pendulum cable) for a fixed duration and assert the final positions/velocities are within tolerance of known good values.
        *   **Conservation Laws (Approximate):** While PBD isn't strictly conservative, check that momentum isn't wildly violated and energy doesn't explode in simple, stable scenarios.
        *   **Specific Feature Tests:** Test complex features like:
            *   Cable wrapping correctly around an obstacle over time.
            *   Cable splitting when encountering an obstacle and then potentially merging back later.
            *   Correct collision responses (restitution).
        *   **Your Current Approach:** The `cable_joints_test.html` file is essentially doing this. You set up a specific world state, run a system (or potentially `world.update()` multiple times in the future), and assert the final state. This is *very* valuable.
        *   **Generated Error Cases:** The `dumpWorldState` function and the resulting test cases (like `testGeneratedError1`) are *excellent* regression tests for specific bugs you've encountered. Keep doing this!

**Best Practices Specific to Your Setup:**

*   **Deterministic Tests:** Absolutely critical for PBD.
    *   Always use a fixed `dt` in tests.
    *   Ensure system registration order is identical between test runs and the main simulation.
    *   Initialize entity positions/velocities precisely. Avoid randomness in tests unless specifically testing random distributions (and then use seeded RNGs).
*   **Floating Point Comparisons:** *Never* use direct equality (`===`) for positions, velocities, lengths, etc. Always use a tolerance (`assertNear` in your test suite). Define a reasonable epsilon (e.g., `1e-6` or `1e-5`) based on your simulation's needs.
*   **Test Data Setup:**
    *   Your `dumpWorldState` is great for complex scenarios.
    *   For simpler unit/integration tests, write helper functions (e.g., `createTestWorldWithTwoBalls()`, `createTestWorldWithCable()`) to reduce boilerplate setup code.
*   **Visualization is Key:** Keep the `cable_joints_test.html` visualization. For physics and geometry, seeing the result is often the fastest way to understand a failure.
*   **Clear Test Naming:** Name tests descriptively (e.g., `testCableSplit_WhenSegmentIntersectsObstacle`, `testCollision_BallHitsStaticObstacle`).
*   **Focus on the Physics/Logic:** Don't test the renderer extensively in your core simulation tests (unless the renderer *reads* data in a way that could fail). Assume the rendering system works if it gets the correct data. Test rendering separately if needed.
*   **Automation:** Integrate these tests into a script or CI/CD pipeline so they run automatically whenever you make changes.

Your current test setup in `cable_joints_test.html` combined with the state dumping provides a strong foundation for Scenario/E2E testing. Augment this with more focused Unit tests for utilities and individual systems, and Integration tests for key system interactions (especially the cable update/solve cycle and split/merge logic).
